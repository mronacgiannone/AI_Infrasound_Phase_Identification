# DRL_Infrasound_Phase_Identification
The initial notebooks in this repository outlines how to read in, preprocess, and visualize the data from McAAP. Following notebooks show how to construct and pre-train InfraCoder. The last notebooks fine-tune and interpret the model's cluster assignments. These approaches are described extensively in the manuscript, "Unsupervised Deep Representation Learning for Infrasound Phase Identification" (in review).
